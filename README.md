# Time Manager

**Time Manager** is a Python-based application that allows users to manage timers, alarms, and stopwatches efficiently. It supports the use of timer templates, customizable sounds, and the ability to run multiple timers at once.

## Features

- Set multiple timers with optional random intervals.
- Create, run, modify, and delete timer templates.
- Set alarms for specific times.
- Run a stopwatch and stop it whenever needed.
- Customizable alarm and timer sounds.
- Ability to stop all active timers with a single command.

## Usage

Run main.py... and that's it. Once the program is running, you will see an intuitive main menu that lets you set timers, alarms, and stopwatches.

## Sounds

You can customize the sounds that play when timers or alarms go off. Place your preferred sound files in the `sounds/` folder (there are some sounds already in there) and select them through the settings menu.

## Templates

Templates are saved in a `templates.json` file and loaded every time the user runs the application.
